The contents cover the fundamental topics of importance in glass science and technology, including glass formation, crystallization, phase separation and structure of glasses. Additional chapters discuss the most important properties of glasses, including discussion of physical, optical, electrical, chemical and mechanical properties. A final chapter provides an introduction to a number of methods used to form technical glasses, including glass sheet, bottles, insulation fibre, optical fibres and other common commercial products. In addition, the book contains discussion of the effects of phase separation and crystallization on the properties of glasses, which is neglected in other texts. Although intended primarily as a textbook, Introduction to Glass Science and Technology will also be invaluable to the engineer or scientist who desires more knowledge regarding the formation, properties and production of glass.","epubVersion":"3.0","contributors":["James E Shelby"],"normalizedPublisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry"},"status":"active","createdAt":"2017-08-10T21:12:10.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-18T15:02:08.000Z","PublisherId":13,"ListBook":{"meta":null,"createdAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","ListId":"b5acac5fbe8f6af2","BookIsbn":"9781782625117","PlanId":"premiumChem","owned":true}},{"isbn":"9781782625346","meta":{"date":2015,"isbn":"9781782625346","type":"epub","flags":{"pages":true,"noCover":false},"title":"Science of Ice Cream","images":154,"pathTo":{"toc":"epub/OEBPS/fm7_contents.html","index":"epub/OEBPS/bm1_index.html"},"language":"en","metadata":{"date":"2015-06-03","role":"aut","cover":"cover-image","title":"The Science of Ice Cream","creator":"Chris Clarke","file-as":"Clarke, Chris","language":"en","meta-auth":"Metadata Authority Inc.","publisher":"RSC Publishing","title-type":"main","display-seq":"1","creatorFileAs":"Chris Clarke","identifier-type":"15","dcterms:modified":"2015-06-03T00:00:00Z"},"CatalogId":"rsocchemistrybasic","copyright":"RSC Publishing","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","description":"Ice cream as we recognize it today has been in existence for at least 300 years, though its origins probably go much further back in time. Before the development of refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions but its advance to commercial manufacture was helped by the first ice cream making machine patented by Nancy Johnson in Philadelphia in the 1840s. The second edition of The Science of Ice Cream has been fully revised and updated with new material. The book still begins with the history of ice cream, subsequent chapters looking at the link between the microscopic and macroscopic properties and how these relate to the ultimate texture of the product you eat. Information on nutritional aspects and developments in new products and processes for making ice cream have been added and the books is completed with some suggestions for experiments relating to ice cream and how to make it at home or in a school laboratory. The book has authenticity and immediacy, being written by an active industrial practitioner, and is ideal for undergraduate food science students as well as those working in the food industry. It is also accessible to the general reader who has studied science to A-level and provides teachers with ideas for using ice cream to illustrate scientific principles.","epubVersion":"3.0","contributors":["Chris Clarke"],"normalizedPublisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry"},"status":"active","createdAt":"2017-08-10T21:12:17.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-17T16:48:03.000Z","PublisherId":13,"ListBook":{"meta":null,"createdAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","ListId":"b5acac5fbe8f6af2","BookIsbn":"9781782625346","PlanId":"premiumChem","owned":true}},{"isbn":"9781782625636","meta":{"date":2015,"isbn":"9781782625636","type":"epub","flags":{"pages":true,"noCover":false},"title":"Organic Chemistry of Drug Degradation","images":270,"pathTo":{"toc":"epub/OEBPS/Contents.html","index":"epub/OEBPS/Index.html"},"language":"en","metadata":{"date":"2015-07-11","role":"aut","cover":"cover-image","title":"Organic Chemistry of Drug Degradation","creator":"Min Li","file-as":"Li, Min","language":"en","meta-auth":"Metadata Authority Inc.","publisher":"RSC Publishing","title-type":"main","display-seq":"1","creatorFileAs":"Min Li","identifier-type":"15","dcterms:modified":"2015-07-11T00:00:00Z"},"CatalogId":"rsocchemistrybasic","copyright":"RSC Publishing","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","description":"The vast majority of drugs are organic molecular entities. A clear understanding of the organic chemistry of drug degradation is essential to maintaining the stability, efficacy, and safety of a drug product throughout its shelf-life. During analytical method development, stability testing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing troubleshooting activities, one of the frequently occurring and usually challenging events would be the identification of drug degradants and understanding of drug degradation mechanisms and pathways. This book is written by a veteran of the pharmaceutical industry who has first-hand experience in drug design and development, drug degradation mechanism studies, analytical development, and manufacturing process troubleshooting and improvement. The author discusses various degradation pathways with an emphasis on the mechanisms of the underlying organic chemistry, which should aid greatly in the efforts of degradant identification, formulation development, analytical development, and manufacturing process improvement. Organic reactions that are significant in drug degradation will first be reviewed and then illustrated by examples of drug degradation reported in the literature. The author brings the book to a close with a final chapter dedicated to the strategy for rapid elucidation of drug degradants with regard to the current regulatory requirements and guidelines. One chapter that should be given special attention is Chapter 3, Oxidative Degradation. Oxidative degradation is one of the most common degradation pathways but perhaps the most complex one. This chapter employs more than sixty drug degradation case studies with in-depth discussion in regard to their unique degradation pathways. With the increasing regulatory requirements on the quality and safety of pharmaceutical products, in particular with regard to drug impurities and degradants, the book will be an invaluable resource for pharmaceutical and analytical scientists who engage in formulation development, analytical development, stability studies, degradant identification, and support of manufacturing process improvement. In addition, it will also be helpful to scientists engaged in drug discovery and development as well as in drug metabolism studies.","epubVersion":"3.0","contributors":["Min Li"],"normalizedPublisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry"},"status":"active","createdAt":"2017-08-10T21:12:30.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-17T16:48:04.000Z","PublisherId":13,"ListBook":{"meta":null,"createdAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","ListId":"b5acac5fbe8f6af2","BookIsbn":"9781782625636","PlanId":"premiumChem","owned":true}},{"isbn":"9781782625773","meta":{"date":2015,"isbn":"9781782625773","type":"epub","flags":{"pages":true,"noCover":false},"title":"Nucleic Acids in Chemistry and Biology","images":448,"pathTo":{"toc":"epub/OEBPS/xhtml/Cover.html"},"language":"en","metadata":{"date":"2015-8-27","role":"edt","cover":"cover-image","title":"Nucleic Acids in Chemistry and Biology","creator":"G.

The composition of the 'natural' atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere) is described in terms of the physical and chemical cycles that govern the behaviour of the major and the many minor species present, and of the atmospheric lifetimes of those species. An extension of these ideas leads to a discussion of the impacts of Man's activities on the atmosphere, and to an understanding of some of the most important environmental issues of our time. One thread of the book explains how living organisms alter the composition and pressures in the atmosphere, modify temperatures, and change the intensity and wavelength-distribution of light arriving from the Sun. Meanwhile, the living organisms on Earth have depended on these very same environmental conditions being satisfactory for the maintenance and evolution of life. There thus appear to be two-way interactions between life and the atmosphere. Man, just one species of living organism, has developed an unfortunate ability to interfere with the feedbacks that seem to have maintained the atmosphere to be supportive of surface life for more than 3.5 billion years. This book will help chemists to understand the background to the problems that arise from such interference. The structure of the book and the development of the subject deviate somewhat from those usually encountered. Important and recurring concepts are presented in outline first, before more detailed discussions of the atmospheric behaviour of specific chemical species. Examples of such themes are the sources and sinks of trace gases, and their budgets and lifetimes. That is, the emphasis is initially on the principles of the subject, with the finer points emerging at later points in the book, sometimes in several successive chapters. In this way, some of the core material gets repeated exposure, but in new ways and in new contexts. The book is written at a level that makes it accessible to undergraduate chemists, and in a manner that should make it interesting to them. However, the material presented forms a solid base for those who are extending their studies to a higher level, and it will also provide non-specialists with the background to an understanding of Man's several and varied threats to the atmosphere. Well-informed citizens can then better assess measures proposed to prevent or alleviate the potential damage, and policy makers more realistically formulate the necessary controls on a sound scientific foundation.","epubVersion":"3.0","contributors":["Ann M Holloway","Richard P Wayne"],"normalizedPublisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry"},"status":"active","createdAt":"2017-08-10T21:12:45.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-17T16:37:06.000Z","PublisherId":13,"ListBook":{"meta":null,"createdAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-04-20T04:01:20.000Z","ListId":"b5acac5fbe8f6af2","BookIsbn":"9781782625933","PlanId":"premiumChem","owned":true}},{"isbn":"9781782625957","meta":{"date":2015,"isbn":"9781782625957","type":"epub","flags":{"pages":true,"noCover":false},"title":"Science of Chocolate","images":159,"pathTo":{"toc":"epub/OEBPS/xhtml/contents.html","index":"epub/OEBPS/xhtml/Index.html"},"language":"en","metadata":{"date":"2015-7-31","role":"aut","cover":"cover-image","title":"The Science of Chocolate","creator":"Stephen T Beckett","file-as":"Beckett, Stephen T","language":"en","meta-auth":"Metadata Authority Inc.","publisher":"RSC Publishing","title-type":"main","display-seq":"1","creatorFileAs":"Stephen T Beckett","identifier-type":"15","dcterms:modified":"2015-07-31T12:00:00Z"},"CatalogId":"rsocchemistrybasic","copyright":"RSC Publishing","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","description":"The second edition of this international best seller has been fully revised and updated describing the complete chocolate making process, from the growing of the beans to the sale in the shops.
